A little mashup using Sincerial to personalize twitter streams.

TODO:
[X] Create sinatra application for vectorization and ranking
[X] Refactor rankers to handle prefetched items
[X] Send tweets to Sincerial for vectorization and ranking
 - Status, author, timestamp 
[X] Gather interest clicks
[X] Send interest clicks to Sincerial
[X] Sincerial profile based on interest clicks
[X] Author in product vector
[X] Public timeline if not logged in
[X] Links will be links
[X] Menubar with "sign in" if not logged in and "sign out" if logged in
[X] From index.html to a servlet serving index.jsp
[ ] "Sing in" or "Sign out" determined by servlet and shown by index.jsp  
[ ] User servlet handling "sign in" through HttpSession
[ ] User servlet handling "Sing out" through HttpSession

If result is good:
[ ] OAuth with Twitter
[ ] User creation (Sincerial) with twitter-derived userid
[ ] Servlet functionality to profilemanager (in Ruby)
[ ] Basic Android version
[ ] UI/UX improved Android version
